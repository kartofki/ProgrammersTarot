            "You’ve just started out, IDE open, caffeine ready, and not a clue what’s ahead. Everything feels exciting and possible, even if you don’t really know what a pointer is yet. You write code with full confidence and zero backup plans. Sometimes it works, sometimes the whole app crashes and you just stare at the terminal hoping it’ll explain itself. The Fool is that moment when you jump in with both feet, not knowing where you'll land. It’s chaotic, but that’s where the magic happens.",
            "You didn’t check the tests, you barely ran the app, and yet here you are clicking 'push' like it’s nobody’s business. Maybe the branch is called 'final_final_OK2' and you’re pretty sure it’ll work this time. The Fool shows up when you're about to do something bold, possibly stupid, but full of hope. It`s that 'we`ll fix it later' energy that drives most startups. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes you break prod and pretend you didn’t see the Slack messages. But hey, at least you’re learning fast — under pressure, in real time, while the CTO watches.",
            "You`ve got an idea, a fresh repo, and zero concern for whether this thing will ever ship. It’s 2 AM and you’re already convinced this side project is going to change the world. The code is messy, the readme is empty, but you’re vibing. The Fool is that burst of inspiration before reality sets in. Maybe it turns into something cool, maybe it joins the graveyard of half-built apps. Either way, you had fun and probably learned something. And let’s be honest — that dopamine hit from “Hello World” showing up never really gets old."

The Magician shows up when youre in that zone where ideas become code and bugs become features. Youve got a stack, some shortcuts, and a few scripts that make you feel like a tech sorcerer. Everything you build still barely holds together, but from the outside it looks impressive. This card reminds you that its not about knowing everything — its about making the most of what you have. Just dont forget where you stashed that weird function that makes everything work",
            "You might not be a senior dev, but you know how to look like one. The Magician is that moment when you pull off something you didnt think you could, mostly by pretending you understood the docs. You mix confidence with chaos, and suddenly youve got a working prototype. No one saw the 12 failed builds, or the three times you renamed final_version_v2. Its not always clean, but it works — and thats enough for now. Keep casting spells, but maybe leave a few comments this time.",
            "You know just enough to be dangerous. The Magician appears when youre making tools out of duct tape, half-remembered Stack Overflow posts, and whatever framework is trending this month. Youve got five terminal windows open and three ideas that might be genius or total nonsense. Theres a certain flow state where bugs feel fixable, and deadlines feel... negotiable. You dont have all the answers, but you have momentum. Just make sure no one opens your code before the demo."

The High Priestess shows up when the answer isn`t in the docs or the error logs, but in that quiet moment when things finally click. You pause, trace the logic in your mind, and suddenly the bug reveals itself. There`s no obvious solution, just a hunch that you follow until it makes sense. This card reminds you to trust your inner problem-solver. You know more than you think — just give yourself the space to hear it.",
        "You don`t talk much in meetings, but when you do, everyone listens. The High Priestess is that dev who sees everything, speaks rarely, and fixes bugs no one knew existed. You don`t need to prove yourself — you just get it. People might not understand your commit messages, but they somehow always work. This card shows up when you should stop pushing and start observing. Sometimes the smartest move is to sit back and really look at what your code is trying to tell you.",
        "You didn`t read the docs, the ticket is vague, and you`re not even sure what this feature is supposed to do. But still, you sit down, open the editor, and start typing like you`ve done this in a past life. The High Priestess appears when you`re solving problems by feel — quietly navigating the chaos like it all somehow makes sense. It`s not about brute force or clever tricks; it`s about reading between the lines and trusting your instincts. You don`t always need to know why something feels off — you just know. This card tells you to follow that gut feeling — it`s probably right."

You’re thinking about UX, accessibility, maybe even writing real documentation. It’s not glamorous, but it’s solid, thoughtful, and made to last. This card reminds you that some of the best code is built with care, not caffeine and panic. When you take the time to grow something properly, it starts to take care of itself.",

The Empress is what shows up when your little side project starts becoming something you’re proud of. You’re not chasing trends or fast fixes — you’re building with intention, piece by piece. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about being present with your work. When you give a project space and attention, it starts to show potential you didn’t expect. Don’t rush it — let it grow the way it wants to.",

You’ve taken the time to name things well, write decent docs, and clean up that one cursed folder you kept ignoring. This isn’t about impressing anyone — it’s about working in a space that supports you back. You’re setting yourself up for stability, not speed. Keep going — this kind of calm builds real momentum."

Youre not just writing code — youre building a system that other people can rely on. It might not be exciting, but it feels good to clean up the mess and lock things down. Now things make sense, people know where stuff lives, and future you is quietly relieved. Keep leading with clarity — youre building more than just software.",

The Emperor appears when you take charge of the roadmap, clean up the backlog, or finally tell someone their PR is a nightmare. Its not about ego — its about stability, accountability, and keeping the chaos in check. You stop chasing new tools every week and start thinking in quarters, not days. This card reminds you that leadership isnt always loud — sometimes its just making sure things dont fall apart. Step up — it`s time to own it.",
            "Youre done winging it — now youre setting standards and sticking to them. The Emperor shows up when you realize that spaghetti code and last-minute fixes arent scalable. You start writing down rules, structuring files properly, and maybe even saying no to that one weird feature request. Its not glamorous, but it brings peace of mind. Youre thinking long-term now, and it shows. Keep laying down the foundations — youre building something that lasts."

You realize the framework has opinions for a reason, and maybe you`re not the first person to try this. There’s comfort in finding patterns that already work. You don’t have to follow them forever — but right now, they’re saving your sanity. Learn the rules so you can break them with purpose later.",

The Hierophant shows up when you find peace in the rules, not rebellion. You realize that systems exist to make life easier, not harder. Someone already figured this stuff out — and it turns out they weren’t wrong. You’re not just coding anymore — you’re becoming part of something bigger. Embrace the boring parts — they’re often the most useful.",

The Hierophant appears when you start connecting the dots between what you do and why it matters. You find yourself explaining things to others, quoting RFCs, or recommending books no one asked for.

The Lovers show up when you stop chasing trends and stick with the tool that actually fits how you think. Sure, it’s not perfect, but you understand each other. You’ve built stuff together, gone through bugs together — it’s a relationship. Sometimes the right choice isn’t the flashiest — it’s the one that works.",

You care about the user, the team, and the long-term impact of what you write. This isn’t just about tech — it’s about what kind of dev you want to be. You can’t say yes to everything, so make sure the stuff you commit to is worth it. Pick the path that actually feels right, not just the one that looks clever.",

You care about the mission, the team, and the product itself. You’re not just building features — you’re building something you’d actually use. It’s a reminder that coding doesn’t have to feel empty.

You’re pushing through blockers, ignoring the chaos, and trusting that you can polish things later. It’s not about perfect code — it’s about keeping momentum. You can’t win a race if you never leave the start line. You’ll have time to refactor once the feature’s in.",
